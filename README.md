# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Desiring to venture into a new career and gain a plethora of new skills, I made the choice to learn how to code with UT Austins Coding Bootcamp.
In an effort to learn, adjust, make mistakes, and learn how to fix them. I created a Prework Study Guide Webpage.
While working on this project, I encountered many challenges, but was able to take the time to work backward, think, research, and ask questions to help me proceed in my project. Some of the problems that I encountered dealt with the creation of new branches within my directory. I also had to review my work many times to ensure I was using the correct syntax in my code. Through this project, I learned that coding is challenging and yet at the same time very rewarding. I am proud to say that I made the right choice in being part of this bootcamp because I am absolutely loving the experience. Get back to me on that last sentence in a few months...lol.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

The Prework Study Guide is an excellent resource if you are thinking about joining the coding/web development world. Think of it as dipping your toes in water before you take the plunge. Within this guide you can find notes on important sections within coding and web development such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. This resource also allows us to see how programs such as DevTools allows us to see how developmental tools such as JavaScript run. Furthermore, this resource will assist you in learning about the various topics we use during our prework portion of this bootcamp. For example the importance of using proper tools such as  GitHub and GitBash.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
